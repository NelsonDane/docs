# Project Docs

This is a repository for hosting my project documentation. The documentation is built using Sphinx and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

It is available at [https://docs.nelsondane.me](https://docs.nelsondane.me).

## Building the Documentation
To build the documentation, clone the repository, then run the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
make html
```
This will generate the HTML documentation in the `_build/html` directory. You can then open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the documentation.
